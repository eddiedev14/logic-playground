# ðŸ§  Programming Logic Exercises

This repository contains programming logic exercises I'm solving to improve my problem-solving skills.  
Currently using **JavaScript**, with plans to implement them in other languages as I learn them.

Each language is developed in its own branch and merged into `main` through pull requests.

Most exercises are sourced from [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/), where you can view my profile and progress.
